## 🌱 Purpose of ML Evolution Lab

Build real-world machine learning skills by solving practical problems—not just following tutorials. This lab is dedicated to hands-on learning, with one impactful project every week.

Key features of every project:
- 🔍 Based on real-world use cases (healthcare, finance, NLP, and more)
- 📦 Fully reproducible with Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and environment setup
- 🧪 Includes model variations for deeper exploration
- 🛠️ Modular design for easy integration and experimentation
- 📈 Continuous evolution—projects are improved, replaced, or retired as new insights emerge

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Core Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Visual Studio Code
- **Upcoming Integrations:** Docker, MLflow, FastAPI, DVC, Hugging Face
