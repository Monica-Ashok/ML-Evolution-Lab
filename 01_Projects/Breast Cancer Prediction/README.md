# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build, evaluate, and finalize machine learning models for predicting whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.  

The workflow is structured into **modular steps** — preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model experimentation, and final model training.

## 🎯 Project Goals  

This project is designed to guide you through a complete machine learning workflow for breast cancer classification, emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and best practices. Each stage is modular, allowing for easy updates and experimentation.

1. **Preprocessing** ✅  
  - Imported the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** directly from scikit-learn, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility.  
  - Conducted a thorough audit of dataset structure, data types, and missing values to establish a reliable data foundation.  
  - Addressed **missing values** using median imputation, preserving statistical integrity, or removed records only when necessary.  
  - Eliminated **duplicate entries** to maintain data quality and prevent bias in downstream analysis.  
  - Standardized **feature names** for consistency (lowercase, underscores), facilitating seamless integration with analysis tools.  
  - Transformed the **target variable** into categorical labels (`malignant` = 0, `benign` = 1) for clarity and compatibility with ML algorithms.  
  - Detected and removed **extreme outliers** (e.g., `mean_radius` above the 99th percentile) to enhance model robustness.  
  - Exported a **fully cleaned dataset**, ready for advanced exploratory analysis and modeling.  

  *This meticulous preprocessing ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and primed for professional-grade machine learning workflows.*  


2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** ✅  
  - Assessed **class distribution**, confirming a slight imbalance (more benign than malignant), which informs model evaluation strategies.  
  - Generated comprehensive **summary statistics**, including skewness and kurtosis, to characterize feature distributions and identify potential modeling challenges.  
  - Visualized data using **histograms, KDE plots, and violin plots**, revealing feature skewness and clear separation between malignant and benign cases.  
  - Constructed a **correlation heatmap** to uncover multicollinearity among features (notably radius, perimeter, and area), guiding feature selection and engineering.  
  - Analyzed **feature–target relationships**, highlighting concavity, compactness, and symmetry as key predictors for diagnosis.  
  - Performed rigorous **outlier detection** with boxplots and Z-scores, flagging extreme values for careful handling in subsequent modeling.  
  - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction, achieving clear visual separation between classes in 2D space and informing feature engineering.  
  - Compared **grouped means by class**, demonstrating that malignant tumors consistently exhibit larger cell measurements than benign ones.  

  *These EDA findings provide actionable insights, validate data quality, and strategically inform feature engineering and model development for robust, interpretable results.*  


3. **Model Experimentation** — *Coming Soon*  
    - Train and compare multiple machine learning models, including:  
      - Logistic Regression  
      - Random Forest  
      - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)  
      - Support Vector Machines  
    - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    *Experimentation will help identify the most effective approach for this classification task.*

4. **Final Model & Deployment** — *Coming Soon*  
    - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.  
    - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
    - Save the final model for future use or deployment.  
    - *(Optional)* Develop a user-friendly demo application using Streamlit to showcase predictions.

    *This stage will culminate in a deployable solution, ready for real-world use.*
