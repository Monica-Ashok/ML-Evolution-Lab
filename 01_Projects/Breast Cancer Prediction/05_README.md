# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build, evaluate, and finalize machine learning models for predicting whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.  

The workflow is structured into **modular steps** — preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model experimentation, and final model training.

## 🎯 Project Goals  

This project is designed to guide you through a complete machine learning workflow for breast cancer classification, emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and best practices. Each stage is modular, allowing for easy updates and experimentation.

1. **Preprocessing**  
    - Address missing values by either dropping incomplete records or imputing sensible defaults.  
    - Eliminate duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.  
    - Standardize feature names for consistency and easier downstream processing.  
    - Transform the target variable into clear categorical labels (`malignant` vs `benign`).  
    - Detect and remove extreme outliers to improve model robustness.  

    ✅ All preprocessing steps have been completed, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for analysis.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** — *Coming Soon*  
    - Visualize the distribution of each feature to uncover patterns and anomalies.  
    - Generate a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features.  
    - Assess feature importance by diagnosis class to inform model selection.  
    - Check class balance to ensure fair model evaluation and avoid bias.

    *This step will provide valuable insights into the data, guiding model selection and feature engineering.*

3. **Model Experimentation** — *Coming Soon*  
    - Train and compare multiple machine learning models, including:  
      - Logistic Regression  
      - Random Forest  
      - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)  
      - Support Vector Machines  
    - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    *Experimentation will help identify the most effective approach for this classification task.*

4. **Final Model & Deployment** — *Coming Soon*  
    - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.  
    - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
    - Save the final model for future use or deployment.  
    - *(Optional)* Develop a user-friendly demo application using Streamlit to showcase predictions.

    *This stage will culminate in a deployable solution, ready for real-world use.*
