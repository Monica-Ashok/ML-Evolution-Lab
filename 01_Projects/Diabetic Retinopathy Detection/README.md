# Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

# Introduction and Business Rationale

## 1.1. Project Overview
This document outlines the objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes for a technical **proof-of-concept (PoC)** aimed at developing a deep learning model for the **automated detection and classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**. The model will analyze retinal fundus images and classify them into one of five severity grades, from "No DR" to "Proliferative DR."

## 1.2. Business Problem & Opportunity
As a Senior Business Analyst for our Medical Imaging product suite, I've identified a critical bottleneck in the ophthalmic care pathway. Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, and early detection through regular screening is paramount. 

However, the current screening process relies on **manual** interpretation of retinal images by highly trained ophthalmologistsâ€”a resource that is both scarce and costly. This creates significant delays in diagnosis, increases healthcare costs, and limits the accessibility of screening in underserved regions.

This PoC addresses a clear market opportunity: **to leverage Artificial Intelligence to augment the screening process**. An automated DR classification tool, integrated into our existing imaging platform, can serve as a highly efficient "first-pass" analysis. 

It would automatically flag high-risk cases for immediate review by a specialist while confidently identifying healthy cases, thereby optimizing the ophthalmologist's workflow. This would not only enhance clinical efficiency and reduce costs but also democratize access to essential diagnostic services, aligning perfectly with our mission to innovate within the healthcare technology space.

## 1.3. Project Goal
The primary goal of this PoC is to **validate the technical feasibility of using modern CNN architectures to achieve clinically relevant accuracy in DR classification**. 

This project will de-risk the technology and provide the data-driven insights necessary to build a business case for full-scale product development and integration.
